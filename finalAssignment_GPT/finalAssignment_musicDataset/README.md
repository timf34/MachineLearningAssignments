# CS7CS4 - Final assignment
# Author: Giovanni Di Liberto
# Lecturers: Prof. Douglas Leith and Dr. Giovanni Di Liberto

# This folder contains the BiMMuDa dataset (see further details in the readme
# in the corresponding folder). The scripts in this folder process that dataset
# into the simplified and augmented dataset 'inputMelodiesAugmented.txt'.

# Preprocessing was already carried out by running the files in the following
# order: extractMelodies.py, midi2text.py, augmentMidiTranslations.py.
# The additional script melodyPlay.py is provided, which you might find useful
# when carrying out the assignment. Best of luck!
